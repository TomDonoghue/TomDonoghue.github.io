# Resources

This page lists and links resources that I create and/or curate.

## Overview

Much of my work is computational, and methods focused, meaning I've had to developed strategies
to try and keep myself organized, while trying to do robust and accessible science.

In doing so, I have collected, curated, and created various resources to help try to
organize my own work, and share it with others, which are listed and made available here.

## Visualizations

I sometimes create animated visualizations to help demonstrate and explain methods and analyses.

You might see these visualizers show up on my
[blog](blog.html), on
[twitter](https://twitter.com/TomDonoghue),
and/or in individual projects.

### Oscillation Methods Visualizers

A collection of animated gifs for the
[Oscillation Methods](https://github.com/OscillationMethods/OscillationMethods) project,
describing methodological considerations
for measuring and interpreting periodic neural activity.

### Digital Signal Processing Visualizers

A collection of animated plots and gifs for topics related to  digital signal processing (DSP),
especially as it relates to neural data.

### Interactive Oscillation Visualization

A small set of interactive visualizations about some common ideas in electrophysiology
and time series analysis.

## Open Lists

I keep a public collection of available resources on
[OpenLists](https://github.com/OpenLists), with an overview available
[here](https://github.com/openlists/Overview).

The open lists include:
- [Electrophysiology Data](https://github.com/openlists/ElectrophysiologyData),
a list of openly available electrophysiological datasets
- [Electrophysiology Software](https://github.com/openlists/ElectrophysiologySoftware),
a list of software packages for working with electrophysiology data
- [Spike Resources](https://github.com/openlists/SpikeResources),
a list of tooling and resources for single-unit neural data analysis
- [Python Resources](https://github.com/openlists/PythonResources),
a list of resources for learning Python
- [DSP Resources](https://github.com/openlists/DSPResources),
a list of resources for learning digital signal processing
- [Git Resources](https://github.com/openlists/GitResources),
a list of resources for learning git & Github

## Structured Science

I also collect and develop
[resources and templates](https://github.com/structuredscience/)
for organizing research projects.

Mostly, this includes templates, including:

- [A general project template](https://github.com/structuredscience/ProjectTemplate)
for organizing a repository
- [An EEG project template](https://github.com/structuredscience/EEGTemplate)
for organizing and preprocessing projects with EEG data
- [A task template](https://github.com/structuredscience/TaskTemplate)
for designing and organizing code for behavioral tasks
- [A paper template](https://github.com/structuredscience/PaperTemplate)
for writing up a project
