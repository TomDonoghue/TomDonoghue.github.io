Welcome to the blog!

First things first, apologies for the title, I’m sure this is the most abused first-post title for anyone who’s ever been vaguely near a computer (If you’re not sure of the context - [relevant wiki link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)).

This blog page won’t have a strict schedule or topic, but will simply serve as a place for me to post sporadic musings on a range of topics. Recently I’ve found myself writing little snippets of ideas quite a lot, some with a point and purpose, and others more rant-like, so we’ll see what I finish, and decide to post. Likely topics include Science, and Everything Else. Ultimately, this space is likely to simply be a sound board for whatever ideas pop into my head, and a place to indulge a strong skill I have of nerding out on something tangential to my actual work for the day.

Comments should be on - please do post if you have comments, suggestions, questions, criticisms, and/or links on how to stay focused on finishing projects and not get distracted writing blog posts.

If you have any interest in keeping track of my writing here, I have set up an RSS feed, so you can follow that to receive updates about new posts.

Tom
