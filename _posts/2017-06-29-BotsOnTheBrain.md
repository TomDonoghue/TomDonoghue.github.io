This summer I am co-teaching a class for [Clubes de Ciencia](https://www.clubesdeciencia.mx/) called 'Bots on the Brain: Cognitive Science & Bio-Inspired Robotics'.

I am super excited to teach it - but first we need a class to teach! We do have a pretty good outline of what we'd like to do, starting with our syllabus, which you can see [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/MTY7_CourseSyllabus.pdf).

So - any suggestions? Any suggested topics, materials, articles, videos, demos, short stories, relevant sci-fi, contemporary ethical issues, etc, that we could incorporate would be greatly appreciated. It is only a weeks course, and we have a pretty busy schedule planned already, but we'd love to hear other ideas that we may not have thought of!

The class will be taking place in Monterrey, Mexico, in August, and is 1 week long. Instruction is in English, but students are all bilingual Spanish speakers, so materials in Spanish would also be very welcome! Students are typically beginning of Bachelors level, with some advanced high school students.

And yes, you're right, I don't work in robotics nor, do I know all that much about it! This class is co-taught with a local instrutor who is an expert in robotics and brain-computer interfaces, so he is bringing the expertise for that aspect of the course!
