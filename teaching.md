## Clubes de Ciencia
In Summer of 2017 I spent a week teaching a short course in Monterrey, Mexico with the [Clubes de Ciencia](https://www.clubesdeciencia.mx) program, which organizes for local and US-based graduate students to develop and teach hands-on, research focused, science based short courses. These courses are offered to local undergraduate and high school students, to get more hands-on research experience, and as networking / mentoring for students interested in post-graduate education. It was a fantastic experience, and I highly recommend the program. I wrote more about my experiences [here]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2017-08-20-AWeekInMexico %}).

## Academic Connections

![AC_2015]({{ site.url }}/assets/pics/AC_web.png)

With co-instructor & fellow graduate student Eric Leonardis, we created and teach a class for the Academic Connections program at UC San Diego, which offers intensive (75 hours of class over 3 weeks), undergraduate-level courses to advanced high school students. So far we have taught the class for three iterations, each summer from 2015-2017.
We teach a class on Cognitive Science, details and outline available [here](https://academicconnections.ucsd.edu/courses/intro-cogsci.html).

## Teaching Assistant
I often serve as a teaching assistant in the Cognitive Science Department at UC San Diego. Working with the Data Science classes, I have developed teaching materials for Python and Data Science, which are available [here](https://github.com/COGS108).
