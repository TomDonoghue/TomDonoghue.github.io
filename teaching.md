# Teaching

Teaching is one of my favourite things to do, and also something I spend quite a lot of my time doing. Below, you'll find some links to teaching materials that I've developed, as well as an outline the courses I've worked on.

## Teaching Materials

#### Programming with Python

I recently put together a notebook for [getting started with Python](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/PythonBootcamp), that we use in the bootcamp for our incoming class of graduate students. I also have an upcoming appointment teaching a class on Programming with Python, for which all the materials will be available [here](https://github.com/COGS18).

#### Data Science

Working with our classes at UCSD, I have developed teaching materials for Python and Data Science, which are available [here](https://github.com/COGS108), in particular a set of hands-on [tutorials](https://github.com/COGS108/Tutorials).

#### Cognitive Science

Materials & assignments that I have used for teaching Cognitive Science are available [here](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/CogSciClass).

# Teaching Experience / Appointments

## COGS18: Introduction to Python

In the fall of 2018, I will be the instructor-on-record for COGS 18: Introduction to Python.


## Clubes de Ciencia: Bots on the Brain

In Summer of 2017 I spent a week teaching a short course in Monterrey, Mexico with the [Clubes de Ciencia](https://www.clubesdeciencia.mx) program, which organizes for local and US-based graduate students to develop and teach hands-on, research focused, science based short courses. These courses are offered to local undergraduate and high school students, to get more hands-on research experience, and as networking / mentoring for students interested in post-graduate education. It was a fantastic experience, and I highly recommend the program. I wrote more about my experiences [here]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2017-08-20-AWeekInMexico %}).

## Academic Connections: Introduction to Cognitive Science

![AC_2015]({{ site.url }}/assets/pics/AC_web.png)

With co-instructor & fellow graduate student Eric Leonardis, we created and teach a class for the Academic Connections program at UC San Diego, which offers intensive (75 hours of class over 3 weeks), undergraduate-level courses to advanced high school students. So far we have taught the class for three iterations, each summer from 2015-2017.
We teach a class on Cognitive Science, details and outline available [here](https://academicconnections.ucsd.edu/courses/intro-cogsci.html).
