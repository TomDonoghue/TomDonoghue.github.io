# Teaching

My teaching work typically focuses on teaching programming and data science related topics, within the cognitive sciences. Below, you'll find some links to teaching materials that I've developed, as well as an outline the courses I've worked on.

## Teaching Materials

Quick links to teaching materials that I have (co-) developed:
- [Python Bootcamp](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/PythonBootcamp)
- [Introduction to Python (COGS18)](https://github.com/COGS18)
- [Hands on Data Science (COGS108)](https://github.com/COGS108)
- [Introduction to Cognitive Science](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/CogSciClass)

## Teaching Experience / Appointments

### COGS18: Introduction to Python

I developed and built the introductoy programming course 'COGS18: Introduction to Python' for the Cognitive Science department of UC San Diego, and was the instructor-on-record for this class in the Fall of 2018.

This course is a hands-on programming course to introduce cognitive scientists to using the Python programming language. This course continues to be taught and developed by [Professor Shannon Ellis](http://www.shanellis.com).

All the materials for this course are openly available on [Github](https://github.com/cogs18), and on the course website [here](https://cogs18.github.io/intro/).

### COGS108: Data Science in Practice

I worked on and developed many of the materials for the course 'COGS108: Data Science in Practice', a hands on class working through introductory data science in the Python programming language, originally developed by Professor Bradley Voytek.

Materials for this course are all available on [Github](https://github.com/cogs108).

### Clubes de Ciencia Mexico

[Clubes de Ciencia](https://www.clubesdeciencia.mx) is a program which organizes for local and US-based graduate students to develop and teach hands-on, research focused, science based short courses. These courses are offered to local undergraduate and high school students, to get more hands-on research experience, and as networking / mentoring for students interested in post-graduate education. Working with Clubes has been a fantastic experience, and I highly recommend the program. I wrote more about my experiences [here]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2017-08-20-AWeekInMexico %}).

In Summer of 2017 I spent a week teaching a short course in Monterrey, called 'Bots on the Brain', in which we investigated brain-computer interfaces and the interface between robotics and neuroscience. In Summer of 2019, I returned to Clubes, to Ensenada, co-teaching a course with Antonio Garcia called 'Inteligencia Biológica y Artificial: ¿amigos o enemigos?' (Biological and Artificial Intelligence, Friends or Enemies), in which we explored the similarities and differences between biological and artificial neural networks. Materials for this course are available [here](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/NeuroAI).

### Academic Connections: Introduction to Cognitive Science

![AC_2015]({{ site.url }}/assets/pics/AC_web.png)

With co-instructor & fellow graduate student Eric Leonardis, we created and teach a class for the Academic Connections program at UC San Diego, which offers intensive (75 hours of class over 3 weeks), undergraduate-level courses to advanced high school students. So far we have taught the class for three iterations, each summer from 2015-2017.
We teach a class on Cognitive Science, details and outline available [here](https://academicconnections.ucsd.edu/courses/intro-cogsci.html).

### UCSD Cognitive Science: Teaching Assistant

I often serve as a teaching assistant in the Cognitive Science Department at UC San Diego.
