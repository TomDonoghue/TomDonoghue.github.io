## Courses

The following are full, undergraduate level, courses that I have worked on.

### COGS18: Introduction to Python

I developed the introductory programming course 'COGS18: Introduction to Python' for the Cognitive Science department of UC San Diego, which I taught in Fall of 2018. The class is designed as a hands-on programming course to introduce cognitive science students to using the Python programming language. This course us now taught and developed by [Professor Shannon Ellis](http://www.shanellis.com).

Materials for the course are available on [Github](https://github.com/cogs18). These materials are also hosted on a [course website](https://cogs18.github.io/intro/) for students in the class, as well as on a [public facing website](https://introductorypython.github.io/).

### COGS108: Data Science in Practice

I worked on and developed materials for the course 'COGS108: Data Science in Practice', a hands on class working through introductory data science using the Python programming language, for the Cognitive Science department of UC San Diego. This course was created by [Professor Bradley Voytek](https://voyteklab.com/).

Materials for this course are available on [Github](https://github.com/cogs108), and are also hosted on a [public facing website](https://datascienceinpractice.github.io/). We also described the goals and design of this course in this [paper](LINK).

## Other Teaching Experience

The following are short courses and teaching programs that I have participated in.

### Clubes de Ciencia Mexico

[Clubes de Ciencia](https://www.clubesdeciencia.mx) is a program that offers hands-on, research focused, science based short courses in Mexico, taught by a combination of local and US-based instructors. These courses are offered to local undergraduate and high school students who are interested in learning more about scientific research.

In 2017, I taught a Clubes course called 'Bots on the Brain', in Monterrey, Mexico. In this course, we investigated brain-computer interfaces and the interface between robotics and neuroscience. In 2019, I returned to Clubes, co-teaching a course with Antonio Garcia called 'Inteligencia Biológica y Artificial: ¿amigos o enemigos?' (Biological and Artificial Intelligence - Friend or Foe), in Ensenada, Mexico. In this course, we explored the similarities and differences between biological and artificial neural networks. Materials for this course are available [here](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/NeuroAI).

Working with Clubes has been a fantastic experience, and I highly recommend the program. I wrote more about my experiences [here]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2017-08-20-AWeekInMexico %}).

### Academic Connections: Introduction to Cognitive Science

![AC_2015]({{ site.url }}/assets/pics/AC_web.png)

With co-instructor Eric Leonardis, we created a class for the [Academic Connections](https://academicconnections.ucsd.edu) program at UC San Diego, which offers intensive (75 hours of class over 3 weeks), undergraduate-level courses to advanced high school students. We taught this class together for three iterations, from 2015 to 2017. Details on this course, which continues to be taught, are available [here](https://academicconnections.ucsd.edu/courses/intro-cogsci.html).
