# Communicating Science

I'm a big fan of talking about science (and other topics) with basically anyone who will listen. I find unsuspecting audiences to do this with by going on outreach school visits, volunteering at the local sciene fair, and I currently work as a volunteer tutor at [San Diego Refugee Tutoring](http://sdrefugeetutoring.com) which I can highly recommend.

Online, I sometimes post things on my [blog](blog.html), and chatter a bit on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Tomdonoghue).

## Useful Science

I write and edit posts for the website [Useful Science](http://usefulscience.org) which is a group of young scientists working to help provide accessible, useful summaries of scientific developments. I've also been on the Useful Science [podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/useful-science/id1050786656?mt=2) quite a few times, in which we take a much deeper dive into a range of ideas and research articles.
