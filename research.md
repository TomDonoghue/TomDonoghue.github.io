## Overview

The brain is constantly receiving a dizzying amount of information, and yet somehow it is able to systematically parse


In doing this research, I
Research Philosophy:
Words, words, words.

### Oscillatory Phase Selective Presentation

Words, words, words.

### Oscillation Mapping

Words, words, words.

### Automated Meta-Analysis: ERPs

Neuroscience is getting bigger, and thousands of new articles are published every year, way more than individual scientists, or even research groups, can keep track of. To take a particular example, event-related potentials (ERPs), in which the electrical potentials related to perceptual and cognitive stimuli are systematically characterized, has become on such area with hundreds to thousands of new papers published every year. In this project, we seek to automatically scrape data from primary research articles and synthesize data-driven summaries of ERPs, and their relation to each other, and to cognitive processes.
