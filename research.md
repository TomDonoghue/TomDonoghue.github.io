# Overview

The brain is constantly receiving a dizzying amount of information, and yet somehow it is (usually) able to systematically parse the constant onslaught of sensory information, select the important parts, analyze them, and come up with appropriate responses. Understanding the mechanisms by which the brain does this will hopefully not only provide new insight to the basic science of the brain, but also help us to understand some of the the myriad ways in which it can go wrong.

## Research Philosophy

In so far as there is consistency in how I try and do research, it is to value and act on the principles of Open Source, Open Data, Interdisciplinarity and Accessibility. There is a philosophical disconnect between trying to open-up knowledge about the world using closed-up boxes, and to that end, to the extent possible, all code, data, and write-ups will be released, and made accessible.

## Oscillatory Phase

What's up with oscillatory phase? Who knows. Let's try and find out!

## Oscillation Mapping

Where, when, what are oscillations anyways?

## Automated Meta-Analysis of ERPs

Thousands of new articles are published every year, way more than anyone can possible keep track of. The field of informatics offers us tools to help parse, organize and summarize the literature. In this project, we leverage these tools for a particular subset of the neuroscience literature - that using the method of event-related potentials (ERPs) - scraping literature data from PubMed and use automated procedures to create data-driven summaries of ERPs, as well as work to extract patterns from across the literature.
The full project is available [here.](tomdonoghue.github.io/ERP_SCANR)
