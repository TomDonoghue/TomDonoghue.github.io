# Overview

The brain is constantly receiving a dizzying amount of information, and yet somehow it is (usually) able to systematically parse the constant onslaught of sensory information, select the important parts, analyze them, and come up with appropriate responses. Understanding the mechanisms by which the brain does this will hopefully not only provide new insight to the basic science of the brain, but also help us to understand some of the the myriad ways in which it can go wrong.

All of the projects outlined here are done at the [Voytek Lab](http://voyteklab.com), with many thanks to Professor Bradley Voytek and the rest of the lab, and in particular research assistants Will Fox, Aeri Kim, Priya Sebastien and Luyanda Mdanda, without whom none of this would actually get done.

Conference posters are available by clicking on the links, and where projects are close to completion, links are available to pre-prints and/or project websites.

## Oscillatory Phase

What's up with oscillatory phase? Who knows. Let's try and find out!

The online presentation brain-computer interface and task validation was presented at [SfN-2015](). A follow up (offline) experiment examining the role of oscillatory phase in perceptual and/or attentional processes was presented at [SfN-2016]().

## Oscillation Mapping

Where, when, what are oscillations anyways?

This project has been presented at [Biomag-2016](), and [SfN-2016]().

## Automated Meta-Analysis of ERPs

Thousands of new articles are published every year, way more than anyone can possible keep track of. The field of informatics offers us tools to help parse, organize and summarize the literature. In this project, we leverage these tools for a particular subset of the neuroscience literature - that using the method of event-related potentials (ERPs). Using the PubMed API allows us to scrape relevant literature, and use automated procedures to create data-driven summaries of ERPs, as well as work to extract patterns from across the literature.

This project was presented at [CNS-2017](), and the full project is hosted online [here.](tomdonoghue.github.io/ERP_SCANR)
