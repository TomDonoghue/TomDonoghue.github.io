# Welcome!

Hello, I'm Tom! I'm a scientist, and I work on research in the area of computational and cognitive neuroscience. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Voytek Lab](https://voyteklab.com/), where I also did my PhD. I will soon be starting as a postdoc in the laboratory of [Dr. Joshua Jacobs](http://orion.bme.columbia.edu/jacobs/) at Columbia University.

I work on [research](research.html) focused on methods and applications of analyzing periodic and aperiodic electrophysiological neural activity and how it relates to neural computation, cognition, and disease.

For a summary of my professional life conveniently written down, you can check out my [CV]({{ site.url }}/assets/CV.pdf), and/or you can jump straight to a list of my [publications](publications.html).

On this site you can find out a bit about me and my work, including:

- 1) [Research](research.html): general descriptions of research that I work on
- 2) [Code & Resources](code.html): links and descriptions of software and resources that I work on
- 3) [Teaching](teaching.html): links and descriptions of my teaching activities
- 4) [Blog](blog.html): miscellaneous writing, including a mixture of research and personal topics

## Brief Profile

I grew up in Quebec, Canada, in a small town full of ski hills and colourful autumn leaves. I went to university and studied Cognitive Science, a major I chose because in the face of my indecisiveness, it's interdisciplinary approach still allowed for a breadth of exploration. I soon discovered how interdisciplinary approaches can allow for investigating broad and interesting questions from multiple distinct perspectives. After some experience working in research labs, I decided to apply to grad school to continue in research.

In graduate school, I started to focus more and more on computation approaches and software tooling, as dug into the ways that we need and use technical skills and tooling to answer research questions of interest. Luckily, my grad school experience allowed me the flexibility to dive into scientific computing and open-source tool development, which have become key parts of my [work](code.html). This led me to a [research](research.html) focus on trying to understand electrical signals in the brain - investigating how we can measure them, and what they might mean in relation to cognition and disease.

Now, working as a postdoc, my interests cover questions of interest in functional neural organization and signaling, as well as practical elements of how we develop and use particular methods in science. This means, to me, doing science that is transparent and accessible, including using and releasing open data as well as developing openly accessible tools and resources. I also think it's important to working towards making science more equitable and inclusive for all, and in this quest I try to learn from and work with groups and programs such as the
[SPARK society](https://www.sparksociety.org/),
[Cientifico Latino](https://www.cientificolatino.com/) and
[Clubes de Ciencia](https://www.clubesdeciencia.mx/).

Ultimately, one of my favorite things about working in science is getting to work with lots of amazing people. I have been extremely lucky to have some amazing mentors who have guided me in my journey so far. Everything I work on is some form of collaboration across many wonderful research assistants, collaborators, teaching assistants and code contributors whose work and contributions are reflected in everything I do.
