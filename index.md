# Welcome!
{: refdef}

Hello, I'm Tom! I'm a Lecturer of Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Manchester.
My research is focused on electrophysiological recordings in human subjects, including
methods and applications for analyzing single-unit, periodic, and aperiodic electrophysiological
neural activity and how it relates to neural computation, cognition, and disease.
For a high-level overview, my research work has been covered in
[Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/brains-background-noise-may-hold-clues-to-persistent-mysteries-20210208/)
(reprinted by [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/the-brains-background-noise-may-be-meaningful-after-all/)),
and is also described on the [research](research.html) page.

For the full scientific version, you can check out my list of
[publications](publications.html), and/or my

## Brief Profile

When starting university, I chose to study Cognitive Science, a major I originally chose as it offered
a way to explore multiple topics of interest across the fields of psychology and biology. This fostered
my interest for how interdisciplinary approaches allow for investigating broad and interesting questions
from multiple distinct perspectives. As I got more involved in research, I realized that a lot of the
day-to-day work in psychology / neuroscience / cognitive science relies on developing and applying computational
measures and analyses to often large and complex datasets. This started me down the path of furthering my
understanding and skills in methods development, software, and computational analyses - all in the service of
better investigating questions of interest in cognitive neuroscience.

To pursue these questions, I did my PhD program, also in Cognitive Science, in the lab of
[Prof. Bradley Voytek](https://voyteklab.com/). In particular, I became interested in questions relating to
how to best measure and interpret features of interest in neural data, especially with electrophysiological
recordings of brain activity that can provide direct information on patterns of activity in the brain with
high temporal precision. This led me to a [research](research.html) program focusing on trying to understand
electrical signals in the brain - investigating how we can measure them, and what they might mean physiologically.
After my PhD, I continued this work during my postdoc with Prof. Joshua Jacobs, in which I worked on
methods and empirical analyses intracranial recordings from human neuro-surgical patients, including
human single-neuron recordings.

Across all of my research, my work often focuses on open-source tool development and other
[code contributions](code.html), as well as employing and developing approaches that
are transparent and accessible (for example, using and releasing open data and developing openly
accessible tools and [resources](resources.html)). Ultimately, this work is in service of improving
and supporting empirical work, and my work is embedded into empirical data analysis through the
examination of openly available datasets and multiple collaborations, covering topics including
investigating functional neural organization, methods development for neuro-electrophysiological data,
and investigating how patterns of electrical neural activity relate to cognition and disease.

Ultimately, to me one of the main joys of science is getting to work with lots of interesting people,
with all of my work drawing directly or indirectly from collaborations across many wonderful mentors,
research assistants, colleagues, collaborators, teaching assistants and code contributors.
If you are interested in the work that I do, and/or would be
interested in collaborating, please do not hesitate to get in contact!
