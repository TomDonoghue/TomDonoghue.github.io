# Welcome!

Hello! I am a PhD Student in the Cognitive Science department at UCSD, working in the [Voytek Lab](http://www.voyteklab.com).

## Overview

Basically, I would like to know how the brain works. In particular, how does it go about organizing all it's seemingly chaotic activity in order to systematically be able to help us do everything that we do? I mainly work on the hypothesis that neural oscillations, neural activity may serve as an organizing principle for neural computation. You can find out more about my research [here.](researhc.html)

I also do a fair amount of teaching, which you can learn more about [here.](teaching.html)

Or, if you want the quickest summary of my professional life convenintly written down, then my CV is available [here.]({{ site.url }}/assets/CV.pdf)

## Research Philosophy

In so far as there is consistency in how I try and do research, it is to value and act on the principles of Open Source, Open Data, Interdisciplinarity and Accessibility. There is a philosophical disconnect between trying to open-up knowledge about the world using closed-up boxes, and to that end, to the extent possible, all code, data, and write-ups will be released, and made accessible.
