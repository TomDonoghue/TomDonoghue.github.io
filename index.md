# Welcome!

Hello! I am a PhD Student in the Cognitive Science department at UC San Diego, working in the [Voytek Lab](http://www.voyteklab.com). My main [research](research.html) focus is on methods and applications of analyzing periodic and aperiodic electrophysiological neural activity and how it relates to neural computation, cognition and disease.

In my work I spend a lot of my time developing [code](code.html). I also [teach](teaching.html) quite a lot and sometimes [blog](blog.html). If you want the quickest summary of my professional life conveniently written down, you can check out my [CV]({{ site.url }}/assets/CV.pdf), or skip right to my [publications](publications.html).

## General Philosophy

I've been trained in an inter-disciplinary Cognitive Science approach, and enjoy work that tries to cut across disciplines and tackle difficult problems with diverse, interdisciplinary teams. I also quite spend a lot of time thinking about science practice - about how we do and teach science. One part of this, for me, means doing science that is transparent and accessible, which in practice means working with and releasing open data, and working on developing openly accessible tools and resources for best practice. I also value work and approaches that recognize and prioritize diversity, inclusion and equality.

## Research Overview

Basically, I would like to know how the brain works. In particular, what fascinates me is the extreme flexibility we seem to have - despite a relatively fixed anatomy, we are able to quickly and flexibly react and respond to any number of things around us, or even within our head. How is it that the brain is able to organize all its seemingly chaotic activity in order to allow us to systematically respond to so many things around us, ultimately allowing for allowing us to do everything that we do?

This area of research can broadly be thought of as investigating the functional organization of brain activity. To do so, I focus on investigating patterns of electrical brain activity that arise from large groups of neurons. In particular, I'm involved in work focused on measuring, analyzing and interpreting both periodic activity, or neural oscillations, and aperiodic activity, sometimes described as '1/f activity', that we see in electrical recordings of the brain. From these signals we try and infer properties of physiological activity and see if we can figure out how the brain might be organizing and processing information. This work includes methods development of software tools, analyzing data from open-access databases, and sometimes running novel experiments with human subjects while we record their brain activity.
