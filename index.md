Hello! I am a PhD Student in the Cognitive Science department at UCSD, working in the [Voytek Lab](http://www.voyteklab.com).

I would like to know how the brain works. In particular, how does it go about organizing all it's activity in order to systematically be able to help us do everything that we do. I research how rhythmic properties of brain activity, called neural oscillations, may serve to organize brain activity.

My CV is available [here.]({{ site.url }}/assets/CV.pdf)
