# Welcome!

Hello, I'm Tom! I'm a scientist, and I work on research in the area of computational and cognitive neuroscience.
I am currently a postdoctoral research scientist in the laboratory of
[Dr. Joshua Jacobs](http://orion.bme.columbia.edu/jacobs/) at Columbia University.
Before that, I did my PhD with
[Dr. Bradley Voytek](https://voyteklab.com/), at the University of California, San Diego.

My research is focused on methods and applications of analyzing periodic and aperiodic
electrophysiological neural activity and how it relates to neural computation, cognition, and disease.
For a high-level overview, my research work has been covered in
[Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/brains-background-noise-may-hold-clues-to-persistent-mysteries-20210208/)
(reprinted by [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/the-brains-background-noise-may-be-meaningful-after-all/)),
and is also described on the [research](research.html) page.

For the full scientific version, you can check out my list of
[publications](publications.html), and/or my
[CV]({{ site.url }}/assets/DonoghueT-CV.pdf).

On this site you can find out a bit about me and my work, including:

- 1) [Research](research.html): a narrative description of my research work
- 2) [Code & Resources](code.html): links and descriptions of software and resources that I work on
- 3) [Teaching](teaching.html): links and descriptions of my teaching activities
- 4) [Blog](blog.html): miscellaneous writing, including a mixture of research and personal topics

## Brief Profile

I grew up in Quebec, Canada, in a small town full of ski hills and colourful autumn leaves.
I went to university and studied Cognitive Science, a major I chose because in the face of my indecisiveness,
it's interdisciplinary approach still allowed for a breadth of exploration. I soon discovered how interdisciplinary
approaches can allow for investigating broad and interesting questions from multiple distinct perspectives.
After some experience working in research labs, I decided to apply to grad school to continue in research.

In graduate school, I started to focus more and more on methods development and computational analyses, as
as started to focus on questions about how best to measure and interpret features of interest in neural data.
Luckily, my grad school experience allowed me the flexibility to dive into scientific computing and open-source
tool development, which have become key parts of my [work](code.html). This led me to a [research](research.html)
focus on trying to understand electrical signals in the brain - investigating how we can measure them, and what
they might mean in relation to cognition and disease.

Now, working as a postdoc, my interests broadly cover topics such as investigating functional neural organization,
methods development for neuro-electrophysiological data, and investigating how patterns of electrical neural
activity relate to cognition and disease. I also think it's important to consider how we do science, including
doing science that is transparent and accessible, such as by using and releasing open data and
developing openly accessible tools and resources. I also think it's important to working towards making science more
equitable and inclusive for all, and in this quest I try to learn from and work with groups and programs such as the
[SPARK society](https://www.sparksociety.org/),
[Cientifico Latino](https://www.cientificolatino.com/) and
[Clubes de Ciencia](https://www.clubesdeciencia.mx/).

Ultimately, one of my favorite things about working in science is getting to work with lots of amazing people.
I have been extremely lucky to have some amazing mentors who have guided me in my journey so far.
Everything I work on is some form of collaboration across many wonderful research assistants, collaborators,
teaching assistants and code contributors whose work and contributions are reflected in everything I do.
