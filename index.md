# Welcome!
{: refdef}

Hello, I'm Tom! I'm a Lecturer of Cognitive Neuroscience at the University of Manchester.
Previously, I was a postdoctoral research scientist in the laboratory of
[Dr. Joshua Jacobs](https://jacobslab.bme.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University, and did my PhD with
[Dr. Bradley Voytek](https://voyteklab.com/), at the University of California, San Diego.

My research is focused on electrophysiological recordings in human subjects, including
methods and applications for analyzing single-unit, periodic, and aperiodic electrophysiological
neural activity and how it relates to neural computation, cognition, and disease.
For a high-level overview, my research work has been covered in
[Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/brains-background-noise-may-hold-clues-to-persistent-mysteries-20210208/)
(reprinted by [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/the-brains-background-noise-may-be-meaningful-after-all/)),
and is also described on the [research](research.html) page.

For the full scientific version, you can check out my list of
[publications](publications.html), and/or my
[CV]({{ site.url }}/assets/DonoghueT-CV.pdf).

## Brief Profile

I grew up in Quebec, Canada, in a small town full of ski hills and colourful autumn leaves.
At university, I studied Cognitive Science, a major I originally chose as it offered a way to
study and explore multiple different topics and areas. This fostered my interest with how interdisciplinary
approaches allow for investigating broad and interesting questions from multiple distinct perspectives.
As I got more involved in research, I realized that a lot of the day-to-day work in psychology /
neuroscience / cognitive science relies on developing and applying computational measures and analyses
to often large and complex datasets. This started me down the path of furthering my understanding and
skills in methods development, software, and computational analyses - all in the service of better
investigating questions of interest in cognitive neuroscience.

In particular, I became interested in questions relating to how to best measure and interpret features
of interest in neural data, especially with electrophysiological recordings of brain activity that can
provide direct information on patterns of activity in the brain with high temporal precision.
This led me to a [research](research.html) program focusing on trying to understand electrical
signals in the brain - investigating how we can measure them, and what they might mean physiologically.
In practice, this work often focuses on open-source tool development and other
[code contributions](code.html). Ultimately, this work is in service of improving
and supporting empirical work, and my work is embedded into empirical data analysis through the
examination of openly available datasets and through collaborations, covering topics including
investigating functional neural organization, methods development for neuro-electrophysiological data,
and investigating how patterns of electrical neural activity relate to cognition and disease.

Ultimately, to me one of the main joys of science is getting to work with lots of interesting people,
with all of my work drawing directly or indirectly from collaborations across many wonderful mentors,
research assistants, colleagues, collaborators, teaching assistants and code contributors.
I also think it's important to consider how we do science, developing and adopting approaches that
are transparent and accessible (for example, using and releasing open data and developing openly
accessible tools and [resources](resources.html)), and making sure we engage in science in ways that
are equitable and inclusive for all. If you are interested in the work that I do, and/or would be
interested in collaborating, please do not hesitate to get in contact!
