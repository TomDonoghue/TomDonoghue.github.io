# Open-Source all the Things!

I work mostly in Python and aim to release code for all my projects, for transparency, and also in case it may be useful to anyone else. Project specific codebases will linked out through the [research page](research.html), but I'll link to more general (project-agnostic) code here.

All code is hosted on Github, either on my [personal page](https://github.com/TomDonoghue), or the [Voytek Lab page](https://github.com/voytekresearch).

### Psychopy Templates

I now use [Psychopy](http://www.psychopy.org) for running behavioural experiments, usually with concurrent EEG recordings. These are templates I use to organize the structure of presentation code, and to save out all the data (multiply and redundantly).

Note that these outlines were developed with basic perceptual experiments with thresholding followed by blocks of large numbers of simple trials, and so they are probably most relevant to that kind of design. There are also templates available for online experiments, related to my [Phase Projects](research.html), for which the actual online presentation code is not yet released. On Github [here.](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/psychopy_templates)

### Python Introductory Tutorials

As extra-materials for an Introduction to Data Science Class at UC San Diego, I wrote out some introductory materials for exploring Python, in particular for Data Science applications. Note that these notebooks are in Python2, and might be out of date. Available on Github [here.](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/python2_tutorials)

### Oscillation Visualization

For a class project, I worked on a very basic website with a set of visualizations to help 'see' some common ideas in electrophysiology and time series analysis. The resulting website can be viewed [here](http://icogsci1.ucsd.edu/~tdonoghu/), and the Github repository is [here.](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/osc_viz)
