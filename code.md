# Open-Source all the Things!

Quick version: my code is availabe on [Github](https://github.com/TomDonoghue), and indexed [here](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/Roadmap).

I work mostly in Python and aim to release code for all my projects, for transparency, and also in case it may be useful to anyone else. Project specific codebases will linked out through the [research page](research.html), but I'll link to more general (project-agnostic) code here.

All code is hosted on Github, either on my [personal page](https://github.com/TomDonoghue), or the [Voytek Lab page](https://github.com/voytekresearch). In the Voytek lab, I am a contributor to our [neurodsp](https://github.com/voytekresearch/neurodsp) toolbox, for processing neural time series, and a core developer of [FOOOF](https://github.com/voytekresearch/fooof), a project to parameterize neural power spectra.

### Data Science Materials

Working with the our introductory classes on Data Science, I have developed a set of tutorial and assignment based materials for coding in Python, aimed at data science (but not neuroscience specifically). ALl of these materials are availabe on the COGS108, Data Science in Practice, organization [here](https://github.com/COGS108), with the main tutorial set availabe [here](https://github.com/COGS108/SectionMaterials).

### Psychopy Templates

I now use [Psychopy](http://www.psychopy.org) for running behavioural experiments, usually with concurrent EEG recordings. These are templates I use to organize the structure of presentation code, and to save out all the data (multiply and redundantly).

Note that these outlines were developed with basic perceptual experiments with thresholding followed by blocks of large numbers of simple trials, and so they are probably most relevant to that kind of design. There are also templates available for online experiments, related to my [Phase Projects](research.html), for which the actual online presentation code is not yet released. On Github [here.](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/psychopy_templates)

### Oscillation Visualization

For a class project, I worked on a very basic website with a set of visualizations to help 'see' some common ideas in electrophysiology and time series analysis. The resulting website can be viewed [here](http://icogsci1.ucsd.edu/~tdonoghu/), and the Github repository is [here](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/osc_viz).
