## Overview

In my work, I write a lot of computer code, mostly in the
[Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language.
I try to always follow
['open-source'](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) practices, making most of my code public.
This includes openly software tools (listed below), code for my research projects (see the [research page](research.html)), and code used for courses that I teach (see the [teaching page](teaching.html)).

My code is on Github, including on my
[personal page](https://github.com/TomDonoghue), the
[VoytekLab page](https://github.com/voytekresearch), and is indexed
[here](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/TomDonoghue/blob/master/codemap.md).

## Open-Source Packages

Below are a list of open-source Python packages that I work on.

### FOOOF: Fitting Oscillations & One-Over F

I am the lead developer of [FOOOF](https://github.com/fooof-tools/fooof), a tool for parameterizing neural power spectra.

FOOOF is a method for spectral parameterization, which takes in frequency representations of neural data, and parameterizes them into periodic and aperiodic components.

[Documentation](https://fooof-tools.github.io/fooof/) -
[Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/fooof/)

### NeuroDSP: Neuro digital signal processing

I am a co-developer of [NeuroDSP](https://github.com/neurodsp-tools/neurodsp), a tool for analyzing and simulating neural time series.

NeuroDSP is a set of digital signal processing (DSP) tools, designed to be used for neural time series, including filtering, spectral analysis, time-frequency analysis, burst detection and more.

### LISC: Literature Scanner

I am the lead developer of [LISC](https://github.com/lisc-tools/lisc), a tool for collecting and analyzing scientific literature.

LISC connects to available APIs, such as for the Pubmed database, and offers functionality to collect scientific literature articles from them, with tools to analyze the collected results.

## Resources

The following are resources that may be useful for organized, robust, open science, including resources I have created, and curated links to external sources.

### Open Lists

I keep a public collection of available resources on [OpenLists](https://github.com/OpenLists), which are listed
[here](https://github.com/openlists/Overview).

The open lists include:
- [Electrophysiology Data](https://github.com/openlists/ElectrophysiologyData), a list of openly available electrophysiological datasets
- [Electrophysiology Software](https://github.com/openlists/ElectrophysiologySoftware), a list of software packages for working with electrophysiology data
- [Python Resources](https://github.com/openlists/PythonResources), a list of resources for learning Python
- [DSP Resources](https://github.com/openlists/DSPResources), a list of resources for learning digital signal processing
- [Git Resources](https://github.com/openlists/GitResources), a list of resources for learning git & Github

### Structured Science

I also collect and develop [resources and templates](https://github.com/structuredscience/) for doing organized research projects.

Mostly, this includes templates, including:

- [A general project template](https://github.com/structuredscience/ProjectTemplate) for organizing a repository
- [An EEG project template](https://github.com/structuredscience/EEGTemplate) for organizing and preprocessing projects with EEG data
- [A task template](https://github.com/structuredscience/TaskTemplate) for designing and organizing code for behavioral tasks
- [A paper template](https://github.com/structuredscience/PaperTemplate) for writing up a project

## Visualizations

I also sometimes create visualizations for projects and methods, including the following projects.

### Digital Signal Processing Visualizers

I sometimes create animated plots and gifs for topics related to  digital signal processing (DSP), especially as it relates to neural data. You might see these visualizers show up on my [blog](blog.html) or on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/TomDonoghue). These visualizations are also available, with associated available, in this [repository](LINK).

### Interactive Oscillation Visualization

This [website](http://icogsci1.ucsd.edu/~tdonoghu/) contains a small set of interactive visualizations about some common ideas in electrophysiology and time series analysis. The source code is available [here](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/osc_viz).
