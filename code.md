# Code & Resources

My work involves writing and using a lot of software, as well as open datasets, and my philosophy is basically 'Open-Source all the Things!'.

In terms of code, I work in Python. I work on developing open-source packages, and also work to make all my project code openly available as well. In terms of data, I mostly use openly-available datasets, and, when I collect data, also seek to make these datasets openly available.

All code is hosted on Github, often on my [personal page](https://github.com/TomDonoghue), or the [Voytek Lab page](https://github.com/voytekresearch). Below are tools and packages I work on. Project specific code will be on the [research page](research.html), and teaching code on the [teaching page](teaching.html). All available code is also indexed [here](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/Roadmap).

## Open-Source Packages

Below are a list of open source Python packages that I work on.

### FOOOF: Fitting Oscillations & One-Over F

I am the lead developer of [FOOOF](https://github.com/fooof-tools/fooof), a tool for parameterizing neural power spectra.

FOOOF is a Python package that takes as input frequency representations of neural data, and parameterizes physiologically relevant features from them, measuring periodic and aperiodic components.

### NeuroDSP: Neuro digital signal processing

I am a co-developer of [NeuroDSP](https://github.com/neurodsp-tools/neurodsp), a tool for analyzing and simulating neural time series.

NeuroDSP is a set of digital signal processing (DSP) tools, designed to be used for neural time series, including, for example, filtering, spectral analysis, time-frequency analysis, burst detection and more.

### LISC: Literature Scanner

I am the lead developer of [LISC](https://github.com/lisc-tools/lisc), a tool for collecting and analyzing scientific literature.

LISC is a tool that connect to available APIs, such as for the Pubmed database, and offers functionality to collect scientific literature articles from them, with tools to analyze the collected results.

## Open Lists

I also work with a lot of open resources, and keep lists of what is available [here](https://github.com/OpenLists).

### Open Data

A list of openly available [neuro-electrophysiological datasets](https://github.com/openlists/OpenData).

### Open Tools

A list of openly available [software packages](https://github.com/openlists/OpenTools) for working with neuro-electrophysiological data.

## Templates

I use and develop templates for my research projects, that are collected and available [here](https://github.com/structuredscience/).

### Project Templates

I use a [general template](https://github.com/structuredscience/ProjectTemplate) for all my projects and supervised projects.

### EEG Templates

Most typically, my projects involved analyzing EEG data, which typically require a similar pre-processing pipeline. To facilitate this, I have [EEG Templates](https://github.com/structuredscience/EEGTemplate) for organizing and pre-processing EEG data, based on using [MNE](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html).

### Task Templates

For developing and running behavioural experiments, I use [Psychopy](http://www.psychopy.org). I use a set of
[task templates](https://github.com/structuredscience/TaskTemplate), that structure a consistent organization for designing tasks, and includes setups for with and without concurrent EEG, and for with or without online EEG.

## Miscellaneous

### Oscillation Visualization

For a class project, I worked on a very basic website with a set of visualizations to help 'see' some common ideas in electrophysiology and time series analysis. The resulting website can be viewed [here](http://icogsci1.ucsd.edu/~tdonoghu/), and the Github repository is [here](https://github.com/TomDonoghue/osc_viz).
