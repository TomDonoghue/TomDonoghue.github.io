## Useful Science

I write and edit posts for the website [Useful Science](http://usefulscience.org) which is a group of young scientists working to help provide accessible, useful summaries of scientific developments. I've also been on the Useful Science [podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/useful-science/id1050786656?mt=2) quite a few times, in which we take a much deeper dive into a range of ideas and research articles.
